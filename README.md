# SMART HOME MOBILE APP

The **Smart Home Mobile App** is a mobile application supported only on android for the moment.  
The main objective of the project is to provide a **centralized solution** for controlling and managing smart home appliances using a single mobile application.

The application enables users to connect to smart home devices through **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication technologies**, allowing real-time interaction with various appliances such as lighting systems, climate control units, and other IoT-based devices. By supporting multiple connection methods, the app ensures reliable communication with a wide range of smart home equipment.

Special attention was given to the design of a **modern, intuitive, and user-friendly interface**. The application is designed to be easy to use, enabling users to monitor and control their smart home environment efficiently without requiring advanced technical knowledge. The clean UI improves usability and enhances the overall user experience.

This project focuses on key aspects of mobile application development, including application architecture, wireless communication, and interaction with smart devices. The Smart Home Mobile App demonstrates practical implementation of smart home concepts and serves as an educational example of developing a mobile solution for home automation.
